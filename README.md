# Description
Malware is one of the major issues regarding the operating system or in the software world.
The android system is also going through the same problems. We have seen other Signature
based malware detection techniques were used to detect malware. But the techniques were
not able to detect unknown malware. Despite numerous detection and analysis techniques
are there, the detection accuracy of new malware is still a crucial issue. In this paper,
we study and highlight the existing detection and analysis methods used for the android
malicious code. Along with studying, we propose Machine learning algorithms that will
be used to analyze such malware and also we will be doing semantic analysis. We will be
having a data set of permissions for malicious applications. Which will be compared with
the permissions extracted from the application which we want to analyze. In the end, the
user will be able to see how much malicious permission is there in the application and also
we analyze the application through comments.
